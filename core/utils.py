    """
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert resume writer and an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) specialist.
    Your task is to take a given resume and a job description, and then rewrite the resume
    to be highly optimized for ATS, ensuring it highlights the most relevant skills,
    experiences, and keywords from the job description. The rephrasing should focus on
    integrating the keywords from the job description naturally into the resume's content.

    **Crucially, keep the resume concise, aiming for a length that would typically fit on one to two pages.**
    **IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any Python-like dictionary structures (e.g., {{'type': 'paragraph', 'content': '...'}}) in the output.**
    **Output ONLY plain text, formatted as described below.**
    **if no relevant experience is found in parsed resume then make a section as as Pofessional Training or Internships**

    Output the rewritten resume in a structured plain text format using "SECTION: Section Name" for major headings.
    Use bullet points for lists within sections, denoted by a hyphen "- ".

    Ensure the following sections are present if applicable:
    SECTION: Contact Information
    SECTION: Summary
    SECTION: Experience
    SECTION: Education
    SECTION: Skills
    SECTION: Projects
    SECTION: Certifications
    SECTION: Awards (if any)

    SECTION: Contact Information  
    Format it like this:  
    Full Name (in UPPERCASE)  
    City, State, Country | Phone | Email  
    LinkedIn - <link> | GitHub - <link>

    Example Format:
    SECTION: Contact Information
    RAHUL DRAVID  
    Bangalore, Karnataka, India | +91-7256745365 | rahuldravid54@gmail.com  
    LinkedIn - www.linkedin.com/in/rahuldravid | GitHub - www.github.com/rahuldravid

    SECTION: Summary  
    Brief 2â€“4 line career summary, job-relevant.

    SECTION: Experience  
    Company Name | Location  
    Job Title | Dates  
-   Use bullet points to highlight key responsibilities and achievements.

    SECTION: Education
    Degree  
    Institute Name | Location
    Year of Graduation | GPA (if applicable)

    SECTION: Skills  
    Organize this in a labeled, grouped format, such as:  
    Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, SQL  
    Web Development: Django, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, REST APIs  
    Database Systems: MySQL (CRUD, optimization)  
    Version Control: Git, GitHub
